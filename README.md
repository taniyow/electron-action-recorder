# electron-action-recorder

A simple Electron desktop application that allows a user to record actions such as mouse movements and clicks using RobotJS, and then replay those actions by pressing another button. It also includes a feature to replay the recorded sequence using keyboard shortcuts.

## Quickstart

1. `npm install` to install all the dependencies.
2. `npm rebuild` to rebuild robotjs native modules.
3. `npm start` to start the development server.

### TAKE NOTE

- If encountered issues, try running `npm run rebuild` first to rebuild the robotjs native modules, then run `npm start`.
